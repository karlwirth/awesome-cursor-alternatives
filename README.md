# Awesome Cursor AI Alternatives [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated list of alternatives to [Cursor](https://cursor.com/), the AI-first code editor designed to accelerate software development using Large Language Models (LLMs).

## What is Cursor AI?

[Cursor](https://cursor.com/) markets itself as an "AI-first code editor," aiming to build a development environment where Artificial Intelligence is not just an add-on but a core component of the workflow. It's often built as a fork or utilizes architectures similar to VS Code, allowing it to leverage a familiar UI and extension ecosystem while deeply integrating AI capabilities. Key features typically include:

*   **AI Chat:** Conversational interface integrated into the editor for asking coding questions, getting explanations, brainstorming solutions, and debugging help, often with awareness of your codebase.
*   **AI Code Generation & Editing:** Generating code blocks, completing lines or functions, refactoring existing code, fixing errors, and generating documentation based on natural language prompts or context.
*   **Codebase Awareness:** The AI attempts to understand the context of your entire project or relevant files, not just the immediate code snippet, leading to more relevant suggestions.
*   **AI Debugging:** Assisting in identifying and fixing bugs by analyzing code and error messages.
*   **Inline AI Actions:** Applying AI assistance directly within the code editor without switching context.

## Why Look for Alternatives?

While Cursor offers a compelling vision for AI-integrated development, users might seek alternatives for various reasons:

*   **Editor Preference:** Many developers have deep-rooted preferences for established editors like VS Code, JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ, PyCharm, WebStorm), Vim, or Neovim, and prefer adding AI capabilities via extensions rather than switching editors entirely.
*   **Cost:** Cursor's pricing model (especially for advanced features or team usage) might not suit everyone. Many alternatives offer generous free tiers or are fully open source.
*   **Privacy Concerns:** Using cloud-based AI models involves sending code snippets (or more context) to third-party servers. Some developers or organizations prefer tools offering local models, more transparent data handling policies, or self-hosting options.
*   **Feature Focus:** Specific needs might be better served by tools specializing in certain areas, like code completion accuracy, specific language support, refactoring power, or integration with particular platforms.
*   **Open Source Philosophy:** A preference for using and contributing to open-source tools.
*   **Performance:** Concerns about the resource usage or responsiveness of an AI-heavy editor compared to a leaner setup.
*   **Flexibility and Modularity:** Desire to mix and match different AI tools and plugins within a standard editor rather than using a single integrated, potentially opinionated, AI editor.

This list explores tools that provide AI-powered coding assistance, ranging from direct VS Code extensions to features integrated into other IDEs and standalone AI development platforms.

*   **Tagline:** An open-source visual workspace for building with Claude Code and Codex
*   **Description:** Nimbalyst takes a different angle on the Cursor problem. Instead of bolting an AI chat onto a single code editor, it treats the workspace itself as the surface for AI work. You run multiple agents in parallel, each in its own session, against tasks and files in your project. The agent layer is heterogeneous and pluggable: Claude Code, Codex, and other providers can run side by side, so you are not locked into one model vendor or one CLI. The editing surface is multi-format. Markdown documents, UI mockups, architecture diagrams, data models, code, and diffs all open as first-class editors in the same workspace, which means an agent can draft a plan as markdown, sketch a flow as a diagram, mock a screen, and then implement the change in code without leaving the app. You see AI's changes in red/green, review, and approve them. It runs as a native desktop app on macOS, Windows, and Linux, with a companion iOS app for reviewing sessions and tasks on the go. 
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Multi-agent, multi-session workspace with parallel runs against the same project.
    *   Heterogeneous, pluggable agent providers (Claude Code, Codex, and others) rather than a single locked-in vendor.
    *   First-class editors for markdown, mockups, diagrams, data models, diffs, and code in one app. Collaborate with your editors in the same files.
    *   Red/Green diffs show agent changes. Approve, review.
    *   Tasks, sessions, and file change tracking built into the workspace, not a side panel.
    *   Local-first by default, with an optional self-hostable collaboration server for teams.
    *   Native desktop apps for macOS, Windows, and Linux, plus a companion iOS app.
    *   Extensible via a documented extension SDK for custom editors and tools.
*   **Editor Integration:** Standalone native desktop application (it is the editor, not a plugin to another IDE).
*   **Pricing Model:** Free and open source. Desktop and iOS apps are MIT licensed. The optional collaboration server is AGPL-3.0. No paid tier required to use the core product; users bring their own API keys or model subscriptions for the agents they choose to run.
*   **Why it's an Alternative:** Open-source. Combines visual file editing with session and task management.
